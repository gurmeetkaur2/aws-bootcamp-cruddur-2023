## Task 3 - Installing the latest version of AWS CLI 
To install the latest version of AWS CLI using gitpod workspace, modified the `.gitpod.yml` file in the project with the following configuration for Linux x86(64): 

```yml
tasks:
  - name: aws-cli
    env:
      AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial
    init: |
      cd /workspace
      curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install
      cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT
...
```
**Detailed instructions may be found here** - [Installing or updating the latest version of the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

:a: Configured the values of environment variables using following script-

```sh
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID="111111111111"
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="EXAMPLEACCESSKEY"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="region"
```
**Detailed instructions may be found here** - [Environment variables to configure the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)

:b: Used the following commands to save the environment variables values inside the gitpod environment-
```sh
gp env AWS_ACCOUNT_ID="111111111111"
gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="EXAMPLEACCESSKEY"
gp env AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="region"
```
These saved variables may be seen here - https://gitpod.io/user/variables or may be checked by using this terminal command- `aws sts get-caller-identity` inside the gitpod workspace.

## Task 4 - Create a Budget using AWS CLI 
Created a [Cost and Usage Budget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/budgets/create-budget.html#examples) using the AWS CLI commands.

## Task 5 - Create SNS Topic & Billing Alarm
We need to create a AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) Tpoic with a subscriber first before we create an AWS Cloudwatch billing alarm. Created a SNS Topic using following command on AWS CLI-
`aws sns create-topic --name "my-topic-name"`

and it provided us with a TopicARN. Then, created a subscription by providing my email on which I want to receive billing alerts as follows-

```sh
aws sns subscribe \
    --topic-arn="TopicARN" \
    --protocol=email \
    --notification-endpoint=email@email.com
```

- [X] Using instructions form this [document](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository), ran the following commands to scrub sensitive data from git history-

```sh
cd workspace
git clone --mirror https://github.com/gurmeetkaur2/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023.git bootcamp
